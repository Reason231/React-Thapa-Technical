## use Hook
## Note: It is still a experimental so it's okay to not use it, but know that it exists.


- It is still confused that it is a hook or a api.
- It says that don't use the useContext Hook 
- use is a React API that lets you read the value of a resources like a Promise or context. 
- Syntax => const value = use(resource)
- The main advantage of the "use" state is that it can be used in the conditional statements while the "useContext" can't.
