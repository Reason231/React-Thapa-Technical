## Adding CSS
- index.css is the global css which will be implemented to all the files and it should be imported in the main.jsx.

- App.css is the local css which will be only be applied that import the app.css 

- Note: We need to use className because class is a reserved word for the JS.

- We have written code in the CardList.css and index.css file
