## Why keys are important and how to use it properly.
- A string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array is called keys.
- Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted or get deleted. 
- Rules : 1. Keys must be unique among siblings. 
          2. Keys must not change.
