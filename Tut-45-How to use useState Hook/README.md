## useState() Hook definition
- The useState Hook is a fundamental hook in React that allows you to add state management to your functional components.
- It lets you store and update values that change over time enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces. 


## Key Notes on useState() 
- Functions passed to useState() and setState() runs twice during development mode to prevent developers from running side effects.
- Side effects in programming refers to change or interactions that occur outside the scope of a function or block of code.
- React.js compares previous state and new state using Object.is(). If it finds both are same then it won't re-render.
