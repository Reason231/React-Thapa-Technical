## Dynamic Navigation Bar
- Today we are going to make the dynamic navigation bar without the refresh of page. 
- We are going to work it in the Header.jsx file which is in the layout folder.
- Note: <a> using this can reload the page which we don't want, so we are going to use the <NavLink> which doesn't reload the pages.


Q. Why react is considered as a Single Page Application (SPA) ?
